# /spec-help — Command Reference

Trigger the `spec-skill` skill and display the full command reference.

## Output Format

```
# spec-skill Commands

## Core Workflow

/spec-verify <N>    Verify phase N completion
/spec-transition    Complete current phase, prepare next

## Project Structure
.planning/                All planning documents
templates/                Document templates (17 files)

## Key Rules

- Display this output directly — do NOT start any workflow
- If a user invokes a command you don't recognize, suggest `/spec-help`
- Mention `templates/README.md` for the full artifact reference
